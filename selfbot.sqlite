Looks like you updated to the latest version of Discord.js **without checking** what was new. Well guess what, **everything is new**. V9 changes everything. 
- It requires Node v6.x
- It's been rewritten from the ground up
- Pretty much all your code will need to be updated.

If you want to just forget all this bad dream and get back to work: 

- run the command `npm install hydrabolt/discord.js#indev-old`
- Restart your bot.
- Now you can take the time to update your bot slowly to v9 eventually.

Whatever editor you're using, clicking on any (and I mean any) separator token such as parentheses, square brackets, curly braces, double and single quotes, will automatically highlight the one that matches it. The screenshot below shows this: I clicked on the curly brace at the bottom, it shows me the one on top by surrounding it with a square.

Update Node to at least version 4: https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/
Also update NPM afterwars: `npm install -g npm`

Once complete, reinstall discord.js from your project folder: 
`npm cache clean`
`npm install --save discord.js`

**Confirm that it went well** by trying the following commands: 
`ffmpeg` should output `ffmpeg version (something) [...]`. If not, reinstall ffmpeg.
`python --version` should output `2.7.X` (2.7.11 probably). If not, reinstall python 2.7
`node -v` should be either 4.x.x or 6.x.x. If not, `apt-get remove node` then follow the instructions above again.
`npm list discord.js` should return `discord.js@8.0.0`. If `npm update --save discord.js` does not update to the latest version, fix or remove package.json file and do it again.
`npm list node-opus` should return the discord version as well as the `node-opus@0.2.1` version (currently).

If any of these commands fail, google the error message for your specific OS.   ¬ ªã*¬                                                                                               á évoiceex```js

1‚É£ ensure you have the necessary by running `sudo apt-get update && apt-get upgrade && apt-get install ffmpeg build-essential`
    (Note: Ubuntu 14 or Jessi Rasbpian: install `libav-tools` instead of `ffmpeg`)
2‚É£ ensure that you are on node 6 by downloading from <https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/>
3‚É£ Update npm by running `npm i -g npm`
4‚É£ run `npm cache clean` then `npm install --save --no-optional discord.js`

If you get any errors ensure the following: 

1‚É£ typing `ffmpeg` should output `ffmpeg version (something) [...]`. If not, reinstall ffmpeg.
2‚É£ `node -v` should say `6.5.0` or higher. If not, reinstall it.
3‚É£ `npm list discord.js` should return `discord.js@9.1.0` or higher. If not, reinstall it.

Whatever editor you're using, clicking on any (and I mean any) separator token such as parentheses, square brackets, curly braces, double and single quotes, will automatically highlight the one that matches it. The screenshot below shows this: I clicked on the curly brace at the bottom, it shows me the one on top by surrounding it with a square. Learn this, and how different functions and event handlers "look" like. Even in long bits of code, this works.

Looks like you updated to the latest version of Discord.js **without checking** what was new. Well guess what, **everything is new**. V9 changes everything. 
- It requires Node v6.x
- It's been rewritten from the ground up
- Pretty much all your code will need to be updated.

If you want to just forget all this bad dream and get back to work: 

- run the command `npm install hydrabolt/discord.js#indev-rewrite`
- Restart your bot.
- Now you can take the time to update your bot slowly to v9 eventually. And breathe.2016-09-09 19:51:31É66Ü=3	learn**Useful links for learning JavaScript and Node**:

1. Never omit semicolons, even though it's often valid.
2. Indent consistently. This makes your code much more readable, which aids debugging.
3. Don't make variables global unless you need to. Declare variables in the smallest scope possible.
3.5 If you do need a global variable, and it needs to stay the same (defining number of ms in hour, for example), make it a const so it can't be edited.
4. Use `===` and `!==` instead of `==` and `!=`. The former compares content and type. `2 == '2'` returns true, while `2 === '2'` returns false.
5. Don't repeat the same code 20 times. Make a function for it instead.
6. If you have cpu-intensive code, try to shift that to a child process. Node.js is still single-threaded, so you don't want to block that thread.2016-09-02 15:27:31   U U©                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Å)Ç3	privacy**To prevent any more spam, right-click on the server in the list, select Privacy Settings, and uncheck the only option in this window.**2016-08-16 00:22:02É(Ü!3spoonThere is no spoon, and there is no spoon-feeding.

And as his employee was reading through an explaining his code, more often than not he would get a flash of insight, run out of the manager's office and go back to fix the problem that he had seen in his code, successfully.

Seeing as though this happened way too often, the manager did something different: He placed 2 chairs outside of his office. One was left empty and on the other he sat a large teddy bear that once belonged to his daughter. And then in a meeting he told all his developers: "Before you come to see me with a code problem, I want you to sit down next to the teddy bear, and explain your problem and your code to him. **IF** you still have the issue afterwards, come see me."

While reluctant at first, his devs did as they were asked. And after a month, it came to light that 5-10 hours a week of the manager's time were now freed up for more important tasks, and the teddy bear became the devs' best friend.2016-08-16 00:22:02   2 â«r42yãA3links

- If you have Visual Studio 2013 or 2015, make sure **C++ Build Tools** are installed. Simply create a new Empty C++ project. If prompted to install the C++ files, do so. 
- **Alternatively**, you can install only the Visual C++ Build Tools as a standalone: <http://landinghub.visualstudio.com/visual-cpp-build-tools>
- Some users have reported that installing VLC helps with codec dependencies, so try that. 

Run the following commands to re-install discord.js

`npm cache clean` (to remove any cached versions of discord or its dependencies)
`npm install -g npm` (this will update NPM, and fixed it for some users!)
`npm install --save --msvs_version=2015 discord.js` (change version to 2013 if using VS2013)

If any errors show, attempt to re-install node-opus manually: 

`npm cache clean`
`npm install node-opus`
